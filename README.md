## Features

### **1. Modern Portfolio Theory & Optimization (`mpt_imp.py`)**

- **Data Acquisition:** Downloads historical closing prices for selected stocks (AAPL, WMT, TSLA, GE, AMZN, DB) from Yahoo Finance (2018â€“2025).
- **Return Calculation:** Computes daily log returns and annualizes them.
- **Covariance & Risk Analysis:** Calculates and displays the annualized covariance matrix.
- **Portfolio Simulation:** Simulates 10,000 random portfolios with different asset allocations to estimate expected returns, volatility, and Sharpe ratios.
- **Efficient Frontier Visualization:** Plots the risk-return profiles of all simulated portfolios, color-coded by Sharpe ratio.
- **Optimization:** Uses `scipy.optimize` to maximize the Sharpe ratio under constraints (weights sum to 1, no shorting).
- **Optimal Portfolio Reporting:** Prints and visualizes the optimal portfolio allocation and its performance metrics.

**Usage:**

```python mpt_imp.py```

This will download data, run the simulation, and display plots for the efficient frontier and optimal portfolio.

### **2. Q-Learning Trading Simulation (`Simple-Trading-Sim.ipynb`)**

- **Custom Trading Environment:** Simulates a basic trading scenario with price, cash, and holdings as state variables.
- **Actions:** Buy, Sell, or Hold at each step.
- **Reward Function:** Based on changes in portfolio value after each action.
- **Q-Learning Agent:**
  - Discretizes state space for tractable learning.
  - Implements epsilon-greedy exploration, learning rate decay, and Q-table updates.
- **Performance Tracking:** Trains the agent over 500 episodes and plots the final portfolio value per episode.
- **Visualization:** Shows agent learning progress and trading performance over time.

**To Run:**  
Open the notebook in Jupyter or Colab and run all cells to see the simulation and learning curve.

## Example Plots

- **Efficient Frontier:** Visualizes the trade-off between expected return and risk for thousands of portfolios.
- **Sharpe Ratio Heatmap:** Color-codes portfolios by risk-adjusted return.
- **Q-Learning Performance:** Shows improvement in trading agent's final portfolio value across episodes.

---

## Usage

- **Portfolio Optimization:** Run `mpt_imp.py` to analyze and optimize a multi-asset portfolio using historical market data.
- **Trading Simulation:** Explore `Simple-Trading-Sim.ipynb` to see how reinforcement learning can be applied to trading decisions.
